Blessed are we to live in a country that teaches acceptance and not tolerance, understanding and not ignorance, appreciation and not disregard. Blessed are we to live in a country that  embraces difference and diversity. Blessed are we to live in a country where everyone feels safe. To live in a place where the people to your left and right may have different values, opinions and views, and yet can still live in harmony. Mahatma Gandhi once said that “we must be the change we want to see in the world.” Canada is that change that WE have built over many generations, Canada is living proof that we can build peace and I’m proud to be a part of it.

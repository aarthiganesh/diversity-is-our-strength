Coming from a first generation family whose story is most definetely not uncommon I'm proud and lucky to call Canada home.
Peace, tolerance and equal opportunity alongside a nation that embraces diversity are things I take for granted and we as Canadians
are lucky to enjoy. With all the recent horrifying events I hope we will stay strong and use these hardships as a catalyst for positive change.
